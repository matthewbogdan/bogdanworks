I started this website mostly to track some of the interesting things I've learned in the IT realm. And since then, it's turned into something more formal where I felt the need to write a short bio on myself:

Working in the federal government for 10 years between three different agencies, I've attained a multitude of IT knowledge, awards, and honors. I've mostly focused on software development and project management in my IT career, but I've also attained a number of certificates -- CompTIA Network+ and Security+, Scrum Alliance Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) and Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and most recently Project Management Institute Project Management Professional (PMP). I've also received a Navy Superior Civilian Service award for migrating legacy Navy websites to modern software solutions which marks the â€œfirst significant modernization in 20 years." Currently, I'm in an Executive Potential Program learning about strategic leadership and working on a project that spans multiple federal agencies to establish a podcast program.

In my spare time I assist coaching children's baseball, soccer and basketball, play live music and do some social media marketing.
