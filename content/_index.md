I started this website mostly to track some of the interesting things I've learned in the coding realm. There's a ton of technologies used in today's web development -- there's the standards -- html, css, javascript but there's also additional tools that help you write better code, test and deploy. This website started as a way for me to document some of the awesome technologies I've learned about and to use it as a reference if I ever have to go back to a technology I haven't touched in a while. I hope you enjoy it as well. -->
